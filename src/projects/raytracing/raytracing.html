            About:
        </div>

        One day while I was browsing through social media I found an image of reflective spheres and a few other basic objects. 
        The caption stated the image was rendered using ray tracing, a rendering technique I had heard of but knew little about.
        After a few hours of research, I began working on this project: A JS ray tracing program.
        <br><br>
        This renderer (currently) can render two basic objects: Spheres and planes. It works by projecting a ray for each pixel and seeing what the ray intersects with. If the ray intersects with
        an object the object color is recorded, a ray from that intersection is shot to the point light source to determine the light level (based on distance and blocking objects), and finally a 
        new ray is recursively shot from the intersection in the reflected direction. The reflected ray returns a color value from what it hit, and all of the colors and light levels are accumulated
        to find the final pixel color to display on the screen.
        <br><br>
        My implemenation of this rendering technique has some shortcomings. To start, each pixel can be computed completely independently of each other, thus it would make sense
        to create a parallelized program which computes each pixel at the same time (say by using the GPU). My implementation is purely single-threaded, thus it takes a significant
        amount of time to render even basic scenes (each pixel can be computed quickly, but there are very many pixels in each image). 
        In the future I plan to restart and use webgl to program the GPU to allow for parallelization, potentially even allowing for real-time rendering.
        <br><br>
        Secondly, only two types of objects are currently renderable (Spheres and Planes) and no other light sources besides point light sources have been implemented.
        This means only hard shadows are renderable, and light source reflections are less than optimal. Currently the point light source appears to be a rather large sphere,
        but only the very center is used for computing shadows whereas the rest is simply a white-colored object. In the future I would like to change this lightsource issue
        and add more object types, but for now I am satisfied with the program.
        <br><br>
