            About this project
        </div>
        <div>
            I have always been interested in procedurally generated terrain and objects, but never really knew where to start. While browsing the internet 
            one day I came across a cartoon-ish rendering of Earth, inspiring me to experiment with planet generation.
            <br> <br>
            For this project I learned WebGL as opposed to basic html contexts for increased performace, as I knew I would likely need to render thousands of triangles each frame (30 times per second).
            WebGL requires all object models to be defined in the vertice-indice model, where vertices are 3d points in space and the indices are triples of vertice indexes defining triangles.
            <br><br>
            To generate the spherical planet I started with an octohedron, and iteratively subdivided each triangle into four smaller triangles. At the end of each division iteration, 
            each vertex was normalized to scale it all to a unit sphere.
            <br><br>
            Now, to modify the sphere and color it accordingly, I experimented with a few different methods. First, I tried to randomly extend or contract each vertex, and 
            was left with a fuzzy little sphere which didn't look at all like a planet. Second, I experimented with pushing regions in or out of varying sizes 
            with the hope of producing mountain ranges and canyons and such. This method did work, but the runtime was too long for my liking (>10 seconds for small planets).
            Third, I implemented a basic pseudo-random number generator/hasher and with that perlin noise. By layering a multiple differnet frequencies of perlin noise 
            and offsetting each layer with more random noise, I was able to produce what you now see in the rendering.
            <br><br>
            To color the now lumpy sphere I found the minimum and maximum vertex heights and scaled a color gradient to fit within the range. Thus, in two loops I could color
            each vertex, producing a earth-like model.
            <br><br>
            Along with coloring, I also added perlin noise in the fragment shader to each surface to modify the normal vectors and colors. This greatly
            improved the perceived resolution with minimal computational cost.
            <br><br>
            As for the oceans, I decided to split the model and generate a smooth, semi-transparent blue sphere to go over the existing model. This, with the 
            addition of some elongated noise, produces the appearance of an ocean. Unfortunately, I have not yet implemented depth testing, thus the water is the same 
            color regardless of depth and viewing angle.
            <br><br>
            Overall, I am satisfied with the planet, although in the future I would like to add an atmosphere and a better ocean.
